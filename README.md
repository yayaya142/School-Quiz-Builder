# Automatic Exam Generator - Java Project

This project was developed as part of the "Object-Oriented Programming in Java" course, which aimed to create an automated system for generating multiple-choice exams. The system allows users to manage a question and answer repository, create exams, and save them for future use.

- Generate exams with a customizable number of questions randomly selected from the question bank.
- Support for American-style multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions with text answers.

- Categorize questions as easy, medium, or hard to control the difficulty level of the exams.
- Save the question bank to a binary file for easy loading and reuse.
